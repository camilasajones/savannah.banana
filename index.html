  <h1>My Story:</h1>

  <p>I was born in September of 2018 in South Carolina. When I was still a little
    puppy, I was separated from my mom and siblings and abandoned on the streets.
    I went through fear, cold, hunger, rain and thunderstorms but one day someone
    finally found me and I was took to a shelther where people gave me love, food
    and a place to sleep while they would find a family to adopt me. In November,
    a young and recently married couple saw my cute little face at the adoption's
    group and decided to adopt me. They lived in Maryland, so I took a ride from South
    Carolina to Maryland with some of my friends who were also being adopted.
    I remember my new parents waiting for me. When I arrived my parents gave me
    lots of attention and took me home. When we got home, I remember that I felt
    just like home. I was so happy that I couldn't stop playing and making them
    laugh. Now, I live my dream's life and I'm a spoiled girl.
